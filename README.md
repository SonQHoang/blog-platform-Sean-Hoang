# Running the Application

Create a blog platform where users can read and write blog posts. The system should allow users to register, log in, create, edit, and delete their blog posts. Additionally, users should be able to like, comment on.

# Project Outline

## User Registration and Authentication:

Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality.

## Blog Post Management:

Allow users to create, edit, and delete their blog posts. Each post should have fields for title, content, author, date, and tags.

## Comments and Likes:

- Enable users to comment on blog posts and like/dislike comments.
- Implement a like counter for blog posts.

## Search Functionality:

Implement a search feature to allow users to search for blog posts by title, content, or tags.

## Extra features (Optional)

Include social sharing buttons for sharing blog posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

## Tech stack

It's highly recommended that the backend should be built using Python Django and the frontend be built in React. However, you can use whatever technology you are familiar with. It will not affect your overall evaluation.

## Submission

To submit your challenge, fork this repository and provide the link to your forked repository. You should also update this README to include instructions on how to run your application. Tests are not mandatory but will be considered bonus points if you provide them.

This challenge should take a day at most. It is not expected to be a production ready application and thus will not be evaluated in such a context.
